    <h2>Backend Code</h2>
    <p>
      The backend is built using <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> with a RESTful API architecture. It
      manages tasks and users with full CRUD functionality, integrates with
      <strong>MongoDB</strong> for persistent storage, and uses proper DTOs, services, and
      controllers for a clean architecture. Pagination, filtering, and enum-based status handling
      are also implemented.

    <h2>Frontend Code</h2>
    <p>
      The frontend is developed with <strong>Angular</strong> and
      <strong>Angular Material</strong> for a clean, responsive UI. It communicates with the backend
      API for data, uses services for state management, implements pagination and filtering, and
      includes modals for displaying extra information such as GitHub repository details. Styling
      follows Material Design guidelines.
